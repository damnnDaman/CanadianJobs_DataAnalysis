1,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV), the non-response errors, the imputation errors, and subject matter expertise: A – Excellent; B - Very good; C - Good; D – Acceptable; E - Use with caution; F - Too unreliable to publish."
2,"Occupation estimates are based on the <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/noc/2016/indexV1.3">National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2016</a>."
3,"A full-time job is a job requiring 30 or more hours of work per week."
4,"A part-time job is a job requiring less than 30 hours of work per week."
5,"A professional certification is a designation granted that attests to the person's ability to perform a job or task. Usually, certification is granted if the candidate passes an exam that tests the required knowledge and skills for a job. A certification is generally granted by a certifying agency or a professional association."
6,"The duration of job vacancy is the number of days the job has been vacant. In the context of the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, it refers to the number of days of active recruitment."
7,"A permanent position is one that is expected to last as long as the employee wants it, given that business conditions permit. That is, there is no pre-determined termination date."
8,"A temporary position has a predetermined end date, or will end as soon as a specified project is completed."
9,"Some temporary jobs are seasonal when they are linked to a recurring event (for example, public holidays) or time of the year (for example, summertime)."
10,"Recruitment strategies are methods used by the employer to fill the job vacancy. Employers can report multiple strategies."
11,"A job is vacant if it meets the following conditions: it is vacant on the reference date (first day of the month) or will become vacant during the month; there are tasks to be carried out during the month for the job in question; and the employer is actively seeking a worker outside the organization to fill the job. The jobs could be full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, casual, or seasonal. Jobs reserved for subcontractors, external consultants, or other workers who are not considered employees, are excluded."
12,"The proportion of job vacancies is the number of job vacancies expressed as a percentage of all vacant jobs in the quarter, except for the proportion of seasonal job vacancies, which is the number of seasonal job vacancies expressed as a percentage of temporary job vacancies in the quarter."
13,"The average hourly wage offered by employers for vacant positions. It excludes overtime, tips, commissions and bonuses. Salaries are converted to hourly wages based on information regarding the frequency of pay and the expected average number of hours worked per week. The offered wage may be different from the actual wage paid once the position is filled. If the salary is different among the job vacancies for the same occupation, the respondent is asked to report the lowest wage or salary. When the compensation advertised for the job vacancy is in the form of a salary range or an hourly pay range, the respondent is asked to report the lowest value of the range. If the work will be paid based on, for example, the number of parts produced, mileage or the number of times a task is performed, the respondent is asked to report the expected minimum salary."
14,"Includes ‘Unclassified occupations'. Previously released data for the first quarter of 2015 excluded this category."
15,"Improvements were made to the occupation coding procedures starting in the second quarter of 2017. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of vacancies for which the occupation is unclassified. The new coding procedures do not affect the total number of vacancies."
16,"Starting in the first quarter of 2020, 'constantly recruiting' was removed as a response category for the duration of a job vacancy, and moved to a separate question. At the same time, the job vacancy duration category '90 days or more' was split into two new response categories: '90 to 119 days' and '120 days or more'. Comparison of this data from before and after these changes is not recommended."
17,"Constantly recruiting means that recruitment will continue after the current vacancies are filled."
18,"Data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable due to some Statistics Canada operations being temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic."
